# Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Folder

A portfolio of tools designed to analyze the LNG value chain through the lens of a US Exporter, focusing on Netbacks, Freight, and Thermodynamics.

## USGC Netback & Spatial Arbitrage

**The Question**: Is the Asian premium (JKM) high enough to cover the Boil-off loss and Charter costs of a 25-day voyage via Panama?

**Objective**: To model the US Gulf Coast Export decision. Unlike simple price spreads, this tool calculates the Netback, integrating thermodynamic loss (Boil-off) and Freight volatility to determine whether US cargoes should flow to the Pacific (Asia) or flood the Atlantic (Europe).
